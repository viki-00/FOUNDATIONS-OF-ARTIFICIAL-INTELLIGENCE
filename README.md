<b> Sudoku Solver </b>

Write a solver for sudoku puzzles using a constraint satisfaction approach based on constraint propagation and backtracking, and any one of your choice between the following approaches:
1. simulated annealing;
2. genetic algorithms;
2. continuous optimization using gradient projection.

<b> Discriminative and Generative Classifiers </b>

1. SVM  using linear, polynomial of degree 2, and RBF kernels;
2. Random forests
3. Naive Bayes classifier where each pixel is distributed according to a Beta distribution of parameters α, β.
4. k-NN

<b> Clustering </b>

1. mixture of Gaussians with diagonal covariance (Gaussian Naive Bayes with latent class label);
2. mean shift;
3. normalized cut
